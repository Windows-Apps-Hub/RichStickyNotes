## Libraries

This app is a proof of concept of using [Get.TextEditor](https://github.com/GetGet99/TextEditor) library.

## Warning

1. The app is still in an alpha state. Things are unstable. We suggest not to rely on this app for a stable source of note taking.
2. If you lose some data due to the bug in the app, the history of the files are saved within the local state folder, which is probably a pain to find. In future versions, there will be ways to access the history directly.
